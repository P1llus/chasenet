# Repo for https://chasenet.org/

## About

I might fill out more here later, this is meant to be a repo for my website and blog, built in Go, where all the content is created with markdown files.

It is meant to be very lightweight, simple and easy to read, though it was not written to be used by others as a module anyone is free to clone and modify it to their wishes :)
