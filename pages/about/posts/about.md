## Current work ## {class="title is-4"}
Currently working at [Elastic](https://elastic.co) as a Principle Software Engineer with a focus on third party integrations and implementing GenAI usecases.
</br>

## Experience ## {class="title is-4"}
Engineer with 15+ years of experience in multiple areas of technology though with a focus on security.  
</br>

Worked for many years with system and network administration before moving over to focus solely on security related work.
</br>

From there I worked at a security operation center, did consultancy work for large SOC's in Europe before settling down as a software engineer working mostly with Python, Go and Typescript, though really enjoying learning new languages and technologies.
